        <p class="about mt-3">Tarana Burke founded the me too movement in 2006 to help survivors of sexual violence, specifically young women from lower economic backgrounds to heal. Then, in 2017, because of a hashtag started by Alyssa Milano, a viral conversation about this violence was forced to the forefront of mass media. What started as local, grassroots organizing, has expanded to a community larger than anyone could have imagined. The months since #MeToo spread on Twitter have been about radical community healing. Join the movement, help reclaim the narrative and help hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.
